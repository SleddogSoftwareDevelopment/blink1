Blink
=====

.NET framework for [Blink(1)](http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html)

Ideas from the originial implementation of [ManagedBlink1](https://github.com/todbot/blink1/), but based on direct HID interaction instead of using the supplied C++ dll.

Supports more features than the official library, with a focus on abstracting hardware knowledge away.
